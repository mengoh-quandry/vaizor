// This file ensures all browser-related types are accessible throughout the project
// It re-exports the types defined in BrowserAutomation.swift and LocalBrowserTool.swift

// Note: If you get build errors about these types, ensure the following files are
// included in your Xcode project or Swift Package build target:
// - BrowserAutomation.swift
// - LocalBrowserTool.swift
// - BrowserCommandsEnhanced.swift (optional enhancement)

// The types should be defined in those files and automatically accessible here
// This file serves as a reference point for the type system
